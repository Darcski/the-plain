In the lesson, we started to go through the different assessments, and the similarities between different programming languages 
became more and more obvious. We finished most of them with ease, until we approached the “defchar” function, an abbreviation for 
“define character”. I could understand the basic concept (using binary to print different characters, a bit like coordinates on a 
grid.), but the format was rather confusing. 

With the function, you could only use 11 numbers. If you put anything other than that, an error code came up saying “expected 11 
characters”. I was not sure why this is, but I have come to the conclusion that it is just one of the limitations of the language. 
To create anything more detailed, I’d have to use multiple “defchars”.

After doing so, we were told that we had to save the previous assessment. The rest of the lesson was almost a recap, as we redid 
the previous assessments, and using knowledge found in pages further ahead to enhance the code.

My target this lesson was to do the assessments with knowledge from previous pages, and with some creativity. I believe we met the 
target, and went further.
