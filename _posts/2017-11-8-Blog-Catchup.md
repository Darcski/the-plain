title: Blog Catchup
---

Instead of carrying on with our tragically postponed FUZE Box career, my partner and I decided our blogs needed a bit of an upgrade.

After searching around for some themes, it was obvious that some didn’t work. At the start, we had little idea why this was. We knew 
that some themes requires downloads and installs, so those were off limits. Others, however, seemed not to work for no particular 
reason.

After a bit of searching, I found a few helpful  things in the config.yml, namely: “url” and “baseurl”. The first obvious thing to 
do was to change the url property to our blog’s url. Still, I did not know what baseurl was. It was only after searching around on 
the github pages FaQ, that I found that the baseurl was the repository. This meant I could leave it blank, since this blog is my 
main repository.

For the rest of the lesson, I helped my partner find a theme, and also showed him the difference between url and baseurl. Many of 
them unfortunately also required downloads, which wasted a lot of our time.

In conclusion, I think that in this lesson we were quite productive, and I am happy with the result.
