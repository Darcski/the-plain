In the beginning of the lesson, I went back to try and fix my previous program. After many failures, I used an online source to 
find out where it went wrong. It was quite simple; unlike other languages, you had to repeat the condition twice, e.g: 
if name$ = “bob” or “bob” does not work, but: if name$ = “bob” or name$ = “bob” does.

After a few more rather straightforward assessments (and editing of them), we got onto jumper cables and LEDs. On the FUZE Box, 
there are many ports that are quite hard to keep track of, and we failed quite miserably at the task to light it up. Looking back 
at the booklet did not help much either, it gave us an unclear picture of how they set it up. We were also not quite sure how to 
set up the pins, as I felt that we were pushing too hard.

After a few more minutes of trial and error, we felt that we could do no more and asked the teacher. When he looked at the picture,
he also agreed that it was quite vague and unclear. When he tinkered with the board, he did not succeed where we had failed, and 
after some contemplation I still have no answer to the problem.

I believe we were quite successful at the start of the lesson, and it was only at this point that I have been completely clueless 
throughout the booklet.
