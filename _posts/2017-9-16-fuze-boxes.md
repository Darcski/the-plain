title: FUZE Boxes

In the previous lesson we were introduced to FUZE Boxes, a small computer that allows you to write in BASIC (an acronym for Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code), a stepping stone for more complicated languages.

During the lesson I could see the similarities between this and other coding languages as well (such as Lua), and my partner and I got up to the second part of the booklet, named "Variables". It also went over some basic commands, such as printing to the output, and changing the colour of the text and background which reminded me of Scratch in some ways.

Overall I think it was a fun learning experience trying to figure out things on our own.
