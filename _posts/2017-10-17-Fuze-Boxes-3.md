At the start of the lesson, we finally figured out how to use the “defchar” function properly, and confirmed that the 11 characters
expected were simply a limitation, and the first character identified the function so you could print it. 

During the assessment, my partner [Edgar] and I had to create new sprites to print, and since we knew how the function worked, it 
was simply a matter of deciding what to print. We then messed around with the colour, position and speed at which the sprite 
changes, before proceeding to finish the assessment.

The next part of the assessment expanded on inputs, using them so depending on what you input, a different answer will be created. 
It was quite straightforward, using different operators to analyse them. The code in the chapter was quite simple, if you inputted 
the name “David”, it would print “Welcome back”. Anything else would result in the end of the program.

We edited this to revolve around passwords, and depending on which one you entered it would give you a second change, lock you out 
or print “Welcome back, [name]”. Though at the end of the lesson we encountered a problem with string manipulation, with some 
operators only working with numerators. We are yet to figure out a solution, however I am pleased with our progress in the lesson.
